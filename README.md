# Maze Generator (Solver yet to be implemented)

## Motivation/Origin
This project is a re-implementation and extension of my A-Level maze game project.
Whereas my earlier version only supported a single maze generator and solver, 
this project expands the scope by exploring multiple maze generation and solving algorithms, 
allowing comparisons in efficiency, structure, and results.

### Features
- **Generation Algorithms**:
  - depth_first_search
  - hunt_and_kill
  - binary_tree

- **Solver algorithms (yet to be implemented):**
  - flood fill
  - A* Search

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
  - Built using the Pygame library.
  - The maze is generated visually in real-time, so you can watch it being constructed step by step.

- **Custom Button Design:**
  - Buttons were **designed from scratch using GIMP**.
